    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>To prepare this recipe for a carrot cake, you will need the following ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of oil</li>
        <li>2 cups of sugar</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups of flour </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup of chopped pineapple in syrup</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup of finely chopped pecans</li>
        <li>2 cups of grated carrot</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>The procedure is simple, actually. My mother-in-law taught me the dough/mixture could even be done in a blender. Follow along the next steps.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the "dry" ingredients (i.e. sugar, flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt) in one big bowl and mix them well (preferably use a whisk).</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix the oil, with the eggs. For the eggs, pour one by one in another small bowl previously to avoid mixing spoiled ones into the big mixture.</li>
        <li>Blend all of the ingredients mentioned in the previous steps, get a homogeneous mixture.</li>
        <li>Cover the chopped pecans in flour, add them to the mixture. Add the carrot and the pineapple too.</li>
        <li>Put the mixture into the baking recipient previously covered with butter. Put in the oven at 175 degrees Celsius and  bake for 30 minutes</li>
