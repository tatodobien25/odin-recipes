    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Huevos rancheros is a mexican way of preparing eggs. It is mainly the following: eggs (typically fried, but some do them scrambled)
        put on a fried tortilla, that way the tortilla is cruncy. You put on some fried beans on top of the tortilla, then the fried eggs and 
        finally, the sauce as a topping for it all.
